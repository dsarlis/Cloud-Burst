# 15-619 TEAM PROJECT: TWITTER ANALYTICS WEB SERVICE

- Students will work in teams to design and implement a complete web-service that uses the REST interface
to respond to queries that require running an analytics job on a large twitter data set which is stored in a
database (MySQL, HBASE, etc.). 
- In this team project, student teams are expected to use different tools and services to achieve build a performing web-service that meets the requirements.
- The students' webservices are evaluated through a load generator for a fixed time period (several hours) by measuring the
cost of AWS cloud resources used and their systemâ€™s performance (throughput).
- There is an upper bound on the budget which could cause students to be disqualified. Students are evaluated based on how their
service performs compared to a baseline.
